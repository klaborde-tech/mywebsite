            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Keaton LaBorde, a Computational Scientist at University South Carolina of Beaufort. I am very passionate about data analysis or anything related to data.
               Throughout my time at USCB, I have focused on some real life data analysis as well as working with a group of people to make a video game. 
               This upcoming semester I am excited about computer graphics, intro to data mining and software testing and verification.
               I have developed strong skills in communicating within a group, version control, and using various applicaitons for coding. 
               These experiences have reinforced my passion for data analysis among other jobs. Outside of my studies I like to play video games, bowl, golf, and stargaze.
               As my graduation approaches I am eager to implement the knowledge I have gained into a professional setting and start the next chapter in my career.
               If you're interested in connecting, feel free to reach out-I'm open to opportunities in web developer, software developer, and game developer.
