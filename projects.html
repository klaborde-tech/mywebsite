        <h2>Software & Verification Project</h2>
        <p class="synopsis">Synopsis: This project was made with a group of 4 team members including myself called Dormhub, a mobile friendly full stack application to help faculty for colleges assign tasks to students living in the dorm rooms.
            We followed some real world practices such as Agile methodologies, product visioning, user personas, all while using GitHub.
            The app features role-based access control using JWT tokens for secure frontend-backend communication.
            The frontend of the app was built using React+Vite in Visual Studio Code, and the backend with Spring Boot in Eclipse, using Postman, pgAdmin4, and JUnit for API and logic testing.   
            We deployed the full stack app using Netlify for the frontend and Render for the backend. 
            We then used some basic Search Engine Optimization with keywords, a description, favicon, and an Open Graph preview using the Google Search Console.
            </p>
        <p class="instructions">Instructions: Unfortunately my group members did not decide to keep the backend for our web application running due to financial circumstances. However, below are images for Admin users and Privileged users. 
            You may also access the guest version of the app using the link below.</p>

        <h2>Data Mining Project</h2>
        <p class="synopsis">Synopsis: This project was completed with one other group member for the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning Competition.
            We used various techniques for machine learning in order to predict the outcome of passengers surviving or dying on the night that the titanic ship sank.
            We began by exploring the data to find the most influential variables for survival through preprocessing.
            This included feature-engineering, normalization, standardization, one hot encoding and ordinal encoding for categorical data.
            Once our data was cleaned and prepared we split it into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio.
            To streamline model development and opitimization, we used machine learning pipelines and applied GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
            We made 6 different models including: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
            After training and validating our models, we submitted our predictions to the Kaggle Titanic competition to asses our model's accuracy on the official leaderboard.
