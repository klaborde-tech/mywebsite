        <h2>Database Systems and Management</h2>
        <p class="synopsis">Synopsis: I was tasked with working with a partner in creating a new database based off of the USCB 2024 Registrar data.
                                      We created an ERD in 3rd Normal Form and created mock data for students in 3 different majors including: Information Science and Tech(ISAT), Computational Science(CSCI), and Psychology(PSYCH).
                                      There are 10 students in each grade from incoming to alumni for ISAT and CSCI but only 5 students for PSYCH majors leading up to Fall 2024.</p>                          
        <p class="instructions">Instructions: To learn more about how we created the ERD please download and look at the PNG file.
                                              If you have a blank database please download the SQL file and open it in notepad, then copy and paste this into a query that's assigned to a blank database and run the query.</p>

    <!--Project 4-->

    <section class="project">
        <h2>Data Modeling and Simulation</h2>
        <p class="synopsis">Synopsis: This project answers the financial questions about building a bowling alley on Hilton Head Island.
                                      The simulation takes in some real world data including employee costs, queuing systems for the bowling lanes, seasonal impacts and others.
                                      This simulation was made using VBA Code in Excel and simulates 1 day or 1 year of running a bowling alley.</p>
                                      
        <p class="instructions">Instructions: For more information about the project please download the PDF file and the DOCX file.
                                              If you would like to run the simulation itself please download the XLSM file and enable the macros!</p>

    <!--Project 5-->

    <section class="project">
        <h2>Computer Programming Techniques, Practices, and Tools</h2>
        <p class="synopsis">Synopsis: This project was about finding a relationship between two bringing a weapon to school and threatening people with a weapon in the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System.
                                      I grabbed the data in YRBSS, put it in Microsoft Access, used SQL to filter the data to the variables needed, put that into an excel sheet, used Seaborn and Pandas library in python and created a user friendly data analysis and graph creation.</p>
        <p class="instructions">Instructions: If you would like to learn more about the project please download the PDF file and open in a browser.
                                              If you would like to run the code please download the PY file and the XLSX file. Open the python script in Spyder and run the script!
