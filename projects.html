    <!--Software Verification Project-->

    <section class="project">
        <h2>Software Verification Project</h2>
        <p class="synopsis">Synopsis: This project was made with a group of 4 team members including myself called Dormhub, a mobile friendly full stack application to help faculty for colleges assign tasks to students living in the dorm rooms.
            We followed some real world practices such as Agile methodologies, product visioning, user personas, all while using GitHub.
            The app features role-based access control using JWT tokens for secure frontend-backend communication.
            The frontend of the app was built using React+Vite in Visual Studio Code, and the backend with Spring Boot in Eclipse, using Postman, pgAdmin4, and JUnit for API and logic testing.   
            We deployed the full stack app using Netlify for the frontend and Render for the backend. 
            We then used some basic Search Engine Optimization with keywords, a description, favicon, and an Open Graph preview using the Google Search Console.
            </p>
        <p class="instructions">Instructions: Unfortunately my group members did not decide to keep the backend for our web application running due to financial circumstances. However, below are images for Admin users and Privileged users. 
            You may also access the guest version of the app using the link below.</p>

    <section class="project">
        <h2>Database Systems and Management</h2>
        <p class="synopsis">Synopsis: I was tasked with working with a partner in creating a new database based off of the USCB 2024 Registrar data.
                                      We created an ERD in 3rd Normal Form and created mock data for students in 3 different majors including: Information Science and Tech(ISAT), Computational Science(CSCI), and Psychology(PSYCH).
                                      There are 10 students in each grade from incoming to alumni for ISAT and CSCI but only 5 students for PSYCH majors leading up to Fall 2024.</p>                          
        <p class="instructions">Instructions: To learn more about how we created the ERD please view the image below.
                                              If you have a blank database please download the SQL file and open it in notepad, then copy and paste this into a query that's assigned to a blank database and run the query.</p>
